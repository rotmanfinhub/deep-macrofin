# Deep-MacroFin

Deep-MacroFin is a comprehensive deep-learning framework designed to solve equilibrium economic models in continuous time. The library leverages deep learning to alleviate curse of dimensionality.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

The stable version of the package can be installed from PyPI.

```bash
pip install deep-macrofin
```

### Build from Source (with poetry)
The project is now configured with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and packaging. 
To install the dependencies and run the code:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rotmanfinhub/deep-macrofin.git
```

2. Install poetry by following the official documentation [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

3. Create a poetry virtual environment and install the dependencies and the package
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local # this sets the virtual environment path to be in the local directory.
poetry shell # creates the virtual environment
poetry install --no-interaction # installs the dependencies and the package
```

### Build from Source (without poetry)

For developers, you should clone the folder to your local machine and install from the local folder.

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rotmanfinhub/deep-macrofin.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment (Optional, but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # venv/Scripts/activate using Windows powershell
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements-doc.txt
```

4. Install the package
```bash
pip install -e .
```
