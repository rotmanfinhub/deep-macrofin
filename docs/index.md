# Deep-MacroFin

Deep-MacroFin is a comprehensive deep-learning framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. 
It is inspired from <a href="https://adriendavernas.com/pymacrofin/index.html" target="_blank">PyMacroFin</a>[^1] and <a href="https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde/tree/master" target="_blank">DeepXDE</a>[^2]
